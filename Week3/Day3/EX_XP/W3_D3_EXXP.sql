SELECT * FROM language;

-- Get a list of all films joined with their languages ‚Äì select the following details : film title, description, and language name.
SELECT film.title, film.description, language.name AS language_name FROM film JOIN language ON film.language_id = language.language_id;
-- Get all languages, even if there are no films in those languages ‚Äì select the following details : film title, description, and language name.
SELECT film.title, film.description, language.name AS language_name FROM language LEFT JOIN film ON language.language_id = film.language_id;
-- Create a new table called new_film with the following columns : id, name. Add some new films to the table.
CREATE TABLE new_film (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO new_film (name) VALUES ('Despicable Me 4'), ('Dune 2'), ('Deadpool and Wolverine');
-- Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.CREATE TABLE customer_review (
    review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    film_id INT REFERENCES new_film(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    language_id INT REFERENCES language(language_id),
    title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    score INT,
    review_text TEXT,
    last_update TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
-- Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
-- It should have the following columns:
-- review_id ‚Äì a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
-- film_id ‚Äì references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
-- language_id ‚Äì references the language table. What language the review is in.
-- title ‚Äì the title of the review.
-- score ‚Äì the rating of the review (1-10).
-- review_text ‚Äì the text of the review. No limit on the length.
-- last_update ‚Äì when the review was last updated.

-- Add 2 movie reviews. Make sure you link them to valid objects in the other tables.
INSERT INTO customer_review (film_id, language_id, title, score, review_text) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Must thing to see!', 9, 'I really enjoyed this movie with my family, feels like a high-speed ride.'),
(2, 1, 'Good one', 7, 'The movie was nice, but in a book everything was better!.');
-- Delete a film that has a review from the new_film table, what happens to the customer_review table?
DELETE FROM new_film WHERE id = 1;
-- due to delete cascade all reviews will be automatically deleted from this movie

-- Instructions
-- Use UPDATE to change the language of some films. Make sure that you use valid languages.
UPDATE film SET language_id = 2 WHERE film_id = 3;
-- Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the way in which we INSERT into the customer table?

-- We created a new table called customer_review. Drop this table. Is this an easy step, or does it need extra checking?
DROP TABLE customer_review;
